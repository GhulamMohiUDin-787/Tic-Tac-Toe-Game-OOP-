# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-OOP-
This Tic Tac Toe game is a console-based application implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows two players to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game on a 3x3 grid, where players alternate turns to place their marks (X and O) on the grid. The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
